# Honours Thesis

Progress and projects for my 2016-2017 Computer Science Honours Thesis will be recorded in this reponsitory.

**Supervisor**: Dr. Jeremy Bradbury.

###Problem
---

- **What is the general focus of the game?**

	It aims to be an eduactional game that teaches concurrency and threading as Computer Science *concepts*.

- **Who are we targeting?**
	
	Undergraduate (2rd - 4th) Computer Science students. An introductory level of programming is required.

- **What do we want them to learn?**

	- How threads work, conceptually/abstractly.

		- Lock-based usage
		
		- Shared data/resources
		
		- Thread scheduling (i.e. different number of CPUs)
		
		- How many threads? ( < 10. More than this requires thread pools, which we will not focus on)<br><br>

	- Understand pitfalls (data races, deadlocks, starvation)

	- Understand the purpose of threads and why they are so widely used.

		- Understand performance benefits vs sequential processing.
		
		- Understand that more thread doesn't always indicate better performance.
